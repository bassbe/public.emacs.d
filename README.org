** Portable (Hopefully) EMACS Configuration

  A rebuild of my emacs config to tidy things up and make it portable to other
  machines.

  As it turns out, GitHub reads .org files as markdown.
  
  Org mode also displays:
  - bullet
  - points
    + with indentation
      * ...lots of it
  - and
  - ~think this is supposed to be code, with ~'s on each side~
  - =this as well, made with ='s on either end of the text=
  - *bolded*
  - _underlined_
  - /italicized/
  - _/*ALL THREE AT ONCE*/_

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
