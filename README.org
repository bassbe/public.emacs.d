** Portable (Hopefully) EMACS Configuration

  A rebuild of my emacs config to tidy things up and make it portable to other
  machines.

  As it turns out, GitHub reads .org files as markdown.
  
** Instructions (For Mac, Homebrew instructions only)

  1. I install Emacs via homebrew (with cacao so it will link, then link it), so
     that cask downloads packages for only one version of emacs
  2. Download and install Cask via homebrew
  3. Add cask to your $PATH so that emacs can find the packages
     - Find out where cask is installed
       #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
         brew info cask
       #+END_SRC
     - Copy the filepath and append it to $PATH
       #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
         export PATH="path/to/cask/:$PATH"
       #+END_SRC
  4. While emacs is closed, cd into the .emacs.d/ page and run cask. This will
     install all the packages in the .cask/ directory
  5. If this doesn't work, you may need to change the path to the cask.el file
     as specified in init.org under the heading Cask & Packages
